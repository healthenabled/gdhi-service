 'Peru is facing the historic challenge of taking a quantitative and qualitative leap in improving the health status of Peruvians through a series of reform policy measures aimed at building an integrated health system that strengthens the National System of health.
 Our desire is to reach a health integrally connected, where all the information that is generated in the health system is captured in the place where it is produced and then flows and is shared at different levels, with different roles, and that allows to streamline the processes and procedures; that reduces waiting times and simplifies procedures in an efficient and timely manner.

 Mali initially recognized the need
 for a comprehensive digital health strategy through its experience with
 implementing individual initiatives in digital health. These initiatives included
 consultations with the Toulouse-based European Institute of Telemedicine in
 neurosurgery and remote training in epidemiology for Malian doctors using
 telemedicine in 1996. The eHealth and telemedicine agency of Mali, Agence
 Nationale de Télésanté et d’Informatique Médicale (ANTIM), was created in
 2008.
 ANTIM is a publicly owned institution with a scientific ICT
 focus and is a sub-agency reporting to the MoH. It is responsible for promoting
 and developing digital health initiatives and medical informatics, which
 includes research, training and technical support of digital health solutions.
 ANTIM is also responsible for harmonizing and standardizing processes,
 procedures and software. Its staff of thirty-one includes IT professionals,
 engineers, physicians and support staff.
 ANTIM implements telemedicine solutions, reinforces information systems for
 hospitals, provides continuing education via ICTs and promotes use of ICTs
 for healthcare professionals. In addition, ANTIM designs ICT solutions for the MoH in areas such as intranet and online data services for the MoH Datacenter.
 The secured data management information system developed for the MoH
 by ANTIM will centralize all the national health system data. ANTIM also
 coordinates and promotes mHealth solutions by convening stakeholders once
 a month to an mHealth working group."',

 interesting have been made in the various fields: consultations,
